## Description
The assignment involves the development of a mobile application that functions as an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator, designed to simplify the process of calculating monthly loan payments based on user-provided inputs for loan amount, tenure, and interest rate. The application features an intuitive user interface comprising multiple EditText fields for data entry, alongside buttons for calculating the EMI and clearing the input. Key concepts in mobile development, such as layouts and views, are employed to ensure an organized and visually appealing user experience, while the logic for calculating EMI is meticulously outlined, incorporating error handling to enhance usability. Although intents are not utilized in the initial implementation, the document discusses their potential application for displaying results in a new activity. Overall, the project aims to create a user-friendly tool that makes complex financial calculations accessible to everyday users.
